# Straw Truss - 2019
This is the MATLAB code modeling a Truss Bridge built out of drinking straws. This project was done for the Engineering Mechanics course taken during my undergrad in collaboration with Avani Sheth and Willie Swift. The project contains documentation on the design of the truss bridge, as well as Matlab scripts for simulating two different bridge designs and testing them. The two bridge designs are contained in makeInput.m and makeInput2ndtruss.m, as arrays mapping the connections between various nodes on the truss bridge and positions of each node. When loaded by the trussTest.m script, these bridge maps are simulated, showing the forces applied to each member in the truss, as well as data on efficiency. The last run was saved in the .mat file with the long name. The bridge was constructed according to our design, and performed better than the simulations indicated.
